Title: Building a Simple Calculator App in Android Studio and Pushing to GitHub

Objective:
To install Android Studio, develop a simple calculator Android app, run it on an emulator/device, and push the source code to GitHub for version control.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Android Studio (Hedgehog or latest)

Kotlin

Git and GitHub

Windows/Linux OS

Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. Installing Android Studio:
Downloaded Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio.

Followed installation steps, including SDK and Emulator setup.

Opened Android Studio successfully and configured environment.

2. Creating the Simple Calculator App:
Created a New Project > Selected Empty Activity and named it SimpleCalculator.

Used Kotlin as the development language.

In activity_main.xml, added two input fields, four buttons (+, −, ×, ÷), and a TextView for result.

In MainActivity.kt, added logic to handle button clicks and perform the corresponding operations.

3. Running the App:
Launched emulator (or connected a real device).

Clicked Run.

Tested app by entering two numbers and tapping different operation buttons.

4. GitHub Integration:
Enabled Git: VCS > Enable Version Control > Git.
Committed the project: Ctrl + K.
Created a new GitHub repository called SimpleCalculator.
Used VCS > Git > Push to push code to GitHub using remote URL:
https://github.com/username/SimpleCalculator.git.
Source code successfully pushed to GitHub.

Conclusion:
This lab helped in understanding how to build a basic Android application using Kotlin, handle user inputs, and integrate version control using GitHub. It also demonstrated a complete workflow from development to deployment.
